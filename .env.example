# SECURITY WARNING: Change default password before exposing to internet!
# 
# Quick Setup:
# 1. Copy this file: copy .env.example .env (Windows) or cp .env.example .env (Linux/Mac)
# 2. Edit .env and set a strong POSTGRES_PASSWORD
# 3. Generate secure random password using:
#    - Windows PowerShell: -join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 32 | % {[char]$_})
#    - Linux/Mac: openssl rand -base64 32
#

# PostgreSQL Database Password
# ----------------------------------------
# Used by: PostgreSQL, n8n, Metabase
# Description: Master password for the PostgreSQL admin user
# Security: Use a strong, unique password (minimum 20 characters recommended)
#
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=INSECURE_DEFAULT_CHANGE_ME

# ========================================
# NOTES FOR EXISTING INSTALLATIONS:
# ========================================
#
# If you're upgrading from a previous version, your setup will continue working!
# - n8n: Manages its own encryption key internally (stored in n8n_data volume)
# - Metabase: Manages its own encryption key internally (stored in database)
# - All your existing data, workflows, and credentials are safe
# - You only need to set POSTGRES_PASSWORD if you want to change it
#
# ========================================
# NOTES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS:
# ========================================
#
# - All services are bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default
# - This means they're only accessible from your computer, not from the network
# - Even with the default password, localhost binding provides basic protection
# - However, you MUST change POSTGRES_PASSWORD if:
#   * Exposing services to the internet
#   * Using a reverse proxy
#   * Accessing from other computers on your network
#
# - Keep this .env file secure and never commit it to version control
#   (it's already in .gitignore)
